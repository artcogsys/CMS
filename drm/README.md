# Dynamic Representational Modeling (DRM)


## TO DO

* make iterator work seamlessly
* also make the links between populations neural networks; this also
allows implementation of synaptic delays
* Can we use DRM to reverse engineer the chip or for that matter, circuits in systems neuroscience? Think Ganguli, Bethge, etc.
