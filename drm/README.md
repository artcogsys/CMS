# Dynamic Representational Modeling (DRM)

End-to-end training of neural systems.

Biological constraints + modularity + gradient descent

## TO DO

* make iterator work seamlessly
* also make the links between populations neural networks; this also
allows implementation of synaptic delays
* Can we use DRM to reverse engineer circuits in systems neuroscience? Think Ganguli, Bethge, etc.
* Allow each population to connect to multiple outputs
* Add documentation!
