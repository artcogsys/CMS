# Cognitive Modeling Suite (CMS)

Framework for neural network modeling and analysis of cognitive processes.

## Analysis

Custom analysis tools that can be applied to neural data generated by natural
and artificial brains. Note that much is provided by python toolboxes like
scikit-learn.

### Outline of possible analyses

To do

## Data

Contains datasets and tasks.

## Examples

Examples of how to operate the models.

## Learners

Learning algorithms to train neural networks.
* Algorithms operate on iterators that generate batches based on a dataset or task
* We have Train, Test and Learner objects
* A Train object in combination with an infinite iterator would implement life-long learning

## Models

Different kinds of neural network models.
* A model encapsulates a network (predictor)
* We define custom link functions for e.g. Elman layers
* Monitors can be used to track internal states of models/networks during training and testing

## FAQ

How do I test a new network?

* Just write down a model as in networks.py and run it like one of the examples

How do I check particular network states?

* Either examine a stored snapshot or run a snapshot on some test data while monitoring a state. See examples

How do I perform an analysis as the network is learning?

* See test_learning_analysis.py

How do I deal with missing targets?

* Chainer handles missing targets automatically via the value -1. For floats
there is currently no support.

How do I handle trial-based data?

* The SequentialIterator can be used to process a subset of different trials in each epoch.
The reset_state at the onset of each epoch ensures proper resetting. This requires
n_batches to be set to the (fixed) number of time points of which each trial consists.
This is simplified by a call to TrialIterator. Also requires that the data is organised as a concatenation of trials.

## TO DO

* Add example of a task (data will be dependent on network action)
* Add multiple reinforcement learning algorithms
* Add streaming data handling video/audio/linguistic
* Add Universe integration
* Allow networks to run without input and/or output
* Add experiments (fully worked examples
* Add version testing
* Abstract as much as possible to enable use of other libraries
* Add support for multiple agents in life-long learning setting
* Add facility to compare different models/approaches/optimizers
* Generate full documentation on the fly using Sphinx/Read the Docs
