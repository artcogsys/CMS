# Cognitive Modeling Suite (CMS)

Framework for neural network modeling and analysis of cognitive processes.

## Analysis

Cusom analysis tools that can be applied to neural data generated by natural
and artificial brains. Note that much is provided by python toolboxes like
scikit-learn.

### Outline of possible analyses


## Data

Contains datasets and tasks.

## Examples

Examples of how to operate the models.

## Learners

Learning algorithms to train neural networks.
* Algorithms operate on iterators that generate batches based on a dataset or task
* We have Train, Test and Learner objects
* A Train object in combination with an infinite iterator would implement life-long learning

## Models

Different kinds of neural network models.
* A model encapsulates a network (predictor)
* We define custom link functions for e.g. Elman layers
* Monitors can be used to track internal states of models/networks during training and testing

## FAQ

How do I test a new network?

* Just write down a model as in networks.py and run it like one of the examples

How do I check particular network states?

* Either examine a stored snapshot or run a snapshot on some test data while monitoring a state. See examples

How do I perform an analysis as the network is learning?

* See test_learning_analysis.py

## TO DO

* Add example of a task
* Add reinforcement learning algorithm
